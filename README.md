# Forecasting LGD for NPL's
In this repository, I am sharing all the Jupyter notebooks created to complete my thesis project. This ambitious project aims to predict the Loss Given Default (LGD) for non-performing loans using machine learning models. In the Dataset Preparation section, you can find all the work done to transform the initial dataset, received from the BCC ICCREA group. The complex initial dataset was processed to make it suitable for prediction purposes. I also considered reduced portions of the dataset through feature selection operations and standardized versions. In the remaining Jupyter notebooks, you can find the implementations of various models on the prepared datasets.
